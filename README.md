I developed a Python application to generate QR codes.

This tool allows users to input a URL or text and generate a corresponding QR code, which can be saved and displayed. 

The project involves:
  -Utilizing the qrcode library in Python.
  -Customizing QR code parameters such as size, error correction, and border thickness.
  -Generating and saving the QR code as an image.
